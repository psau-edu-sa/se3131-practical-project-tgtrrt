# fromal specefcation 
### we used a petri net to formal a traffic light
### the rules is that when one traffic sign in on the rest must be off
- The two signals in lanes 1 can be green at the same time and the rest of the signals are red. 
- The two signals in Lane 2 can be green at the same time and the rest of the signals are red.
- The signal in Route 3 can be green and the rest of the signals are red
- The signal in track 4 can be green and the rest of the signals are red 
- The signals should work in the order above 
- Lane 5 signals allow cars to reverse traffic when this does not conflict with another signal. 
- this is the pic of the work
